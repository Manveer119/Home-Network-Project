# Home Network

## Objective

Designed and simulated a small-scale home network using Cisco Packet Tracer to understand basic network design, device configuration, and packet flow between network nodes.

### Skills Learned

<li>Configured routers, switches, and end devices in a simulated environment
<li>Assigned IP addresses and subnet masks manually
<li>Verified connectivity using ping and packet analysis
<li>Applied basic security settings such as passwords and console access
<li>Troubleshot common network issues (e.g., IP conflicts, wrong cabling)

### Tools Used

<li>Cisco Packet Tracer
<li>Windows Command Prompt (Ping, ipconfig)
<li>Subnet Calculator

## Steps
<li>Planned the network layout including devices (router, switch, PC, etc.)
<li>Placed and connected devices using appropriate cables in Cisco Packet Tracer
<li>Assigned static IP addresses to all devices
<li>Configured router interfaces and enabled interfaces
<li>Verified connectivity between all devices using ping tests
<li>Secured router/switch access with basic passwords
<li>Documented network topology and configuration in a README file
<li>Uploaded the .pkt file and supporting documents to GitHub
