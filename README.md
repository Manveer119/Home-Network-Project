# Home Network

## Objective

Designed and simulated a small-scale home network using Cisco Packet Tracer to understand basic network design, device configuration, and packet flow between network nodes.

### Skills Learned

-Configured routers, switches, and end devices in a simulated environment
-Assigned IP addresses and subnet masks manually
-Verified connectivity using ping and packet analysis
-Applied basic security settings such as passwords and console access
-Troubleshot common network issues (e.g., IP conflicts, wrong cabling)

### Tools Used

-Cisco Packet Tracer
-Windows Command Prompt (Ping, ipconfig)
-Subnet Calculator

## Steps
-Planned the network layout including devices (router, switch, PC, etc.)
-Placed and connected devices using appropriate cables in Cisco Packet Tracer
-Assigned static IP addresses to all devices
-Configured router interfaces and enabled interfaces
-Verified connectivity between all devices using ping tests
-Secured router/switch access with basic passwords
-Documented network topology and configuration in a README file
-Uploaded the .pkt file and supporting documents to GitHub
